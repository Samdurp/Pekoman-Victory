# Pekoman Victory
 
I'm Noah Lang and I like to program so I decided to take up a project in my spare time!

When I was a lot younger, I was obsessed with Pokemon, to the point where I drew my own origial Pokemon and even an entire region, with details all the way down to the layouts of the cities and towns. I called it the "Victora Region", which was a clever play on "Victory" in the mind of a 10 year old.

I always dreamed one day of having my creation in a Pokemon game. Being 10 and obsessed, I could think of nothing more amazing than being able to play with the region and Pokemon that I created.

So I decided to fulfill my past self's dream.

This is the Victora Region.
